**Software developer**
Welcome to my internship project repository! During my internship, I worked on several tasks that allowed me to develop and enhance my programming skills. Below is a brief overview of the projects I completed:

**Projects**_
**1. Random Number Guessing Game**
A simple console-based game where the user guesses a randomly generated number between 1 and 20. The user has up to 6 attempts to guess the number correctly. Feedback is provided on whether the guess is too high or too low, and the correct number is revealed if not guessed within the allowed attempts.

Languages/Technologies: Java
Key Features:
User name input
Random number generation
Guessing with feedback
Limited number of attempts
Source Code: RandomNumberGuess.java

**2. Sudoku Solver**
A program that solves Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm. This solver reads a Sudoku puzzle from a 9x9 grid and fills in the missing numbers to complete the puzzle. It ensures that the solution adheres to Sudoku rules where each number 1-9 appears exactly once in each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid.

Languages/Technologies: Java
Key Features:
Backtracking algorithm for solving puzzles
Validation of Sudoku rules
Input and output of Sudoku grids
Source Code: SudokuSolver.java

**3. Temperature Converter**
A utility application that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. Users can input a temperature in one unit and convert it to another unit. The application provides accurate conversion results and ensures correct formatting of the output.

Languages/Technologies: Java
Key Features:
Conversion between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin
Input validation
Clear and formatted output
